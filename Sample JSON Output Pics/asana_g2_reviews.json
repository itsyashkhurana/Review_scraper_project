      "review": "What do you like best about Asana?I think Asana's ease of use is one of its best features. It's intuitive, so even new users can quickly pick it up and start managing tasks and projects without much friction. The layout is clean, and the interface makes it easy to see project timelines, tasks, and team communication in one place.The ease of integration is another huge plus. It integrates well with tools like Slack, Google Drive, and many others, which helps streamline workflows and avoid jumping between different platforms.And I can't leave out the frequency of use—it's the kind of tool that you end up using daily because of how central it becomes in managing team projects and staying organized. Whether it's for tracking deadlines or collaborating with teammates, it's just so reliable!Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Asana?Although Asana provides a lot of flexibility in terms of projects and task views (list, board, timeline, etc.), when it comes to fully customizing workflows, there are some restrictions. For instance, while custom fields are available, they can be a bit cumbersome to manage across different projects, especially when you’re dealing with a large number of them. Advanced custom workflows, like automating specific actions between different types of tasks or creating highly specialized project templates, can be more challenging without using third-party tools or complex integrations.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Asana solving and how is that benefiting you?Asana helps me create clear, structured task flows for handling accounting work requests and approvals. I can easily set up task dependencies, like “Approve expense report” → “Process payment,” and track each step in the process. This ensures that nothing falls through the cracks and that everyone on my team knows their responsibilities. I can also use custom fields to capture important details like invoice numbers or account codes, making sure the information I need is always at my fingertips. This results in smoother workflows and helps me avoid delays or missed tasks.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.",

      "review": "What do you like best about Asana?At The Orchard Church, what we like best about Asana is its intuitive and visual approach to project management that makes collaboration seamless across our ministry teams. The ability to view our work in multiple formats (lists, boards, timelines, calendars) allows each team member to interact with projects in ways that make sense for their role and thinking style.We particularly value how Asana reduces communication overhead by keeping conversations, files, and tasks in one centralized location. This has been transformative for coordinating volunteers, planning events, and managing our weekly service preparation. The task assignment and deadline tracking features ensure clear accountability, which is essential when balancing multiple ministry initiatives simultaneously.The platform's flexibility has allowed us to adapt it to our unique church context without forcing us to change our established workflows. Instead, Asana enhances them by providing structure without rigidity.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Asana?While we appreciate Asana overall, there are a few areas where we've encountered limitations at The Orchard Church. Specifically, we find the integrations could be significantly stronger, particularly with tools that are essential to our operations. The Zapier integration works but often requires complex multi-step zaps to accomplish what should be simpler workflows.Our experience with connecting Asana to Reclaim for time blocking and calendar management has been frustrating at times, with synchronization issues that require manual intervention. The lack of a robust integration with Planning Center Online, which is critical for our church management, means we're constantly switching between platforms and manually transferring information.Even the Google Workspace integration, which should be seamless given how widely used these tools are, has limitations when it comes to advanced document collaboration and calendar syncing. We often find ourselves duplicating work across systems.These integration challenges create efficiency gaps that prevent us from fully streamlining our ministry operations, requiring workarounds that consume valuable time we'd rather spend on our community and mission work.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Asana solving and how is that benefiting you?Asana has solved several critical operational challenges for The Orchard Church, delivering substantial benefits to our ministry:Before Asana, we struggled with scattered communication across email threads, text messages, and paper notes, which often led to missed tasks and duplicated efforts. Now, our entire team works from a centralized platform where all project details, deadlines, and conversations are visible in one place. This transparency has dramatically reduced miscommunication and ensured important ministry initiatives stay on track.Our volunteer coordination used to be particularly challenging, with constant confusion about responsibilities and timelines. With Asana, we can clearly assign tasks, set realistic deadlines, and provide all necessary resources within the task details. This clarity has improved volunteer retention and satisfaction while making onboarding new team members much smoother.Event planning has become significantly more efficient. From Sunday services to special events like community outreaches and holiday programs, we now have clear project templates that ensure consistent execution and prevent last-minute scrambling. The visual timeline feature helps us spot scheduling conflicts before they become problems.Perhaps most importantly, Asana has freed our staff from excessive administrative burden, allowing us to focus more energy on people and ministry rather than logistics. We spend less time in coordination meetings because everyone can see the status of projects in real-time, which has created more space for the relational aspects of our church work.The ultimate benefit has been our increased capacity to serve our congregation and community more effectively with the same size team.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.",

      "review": "What do you like best about Asana?I work in a multi-library system and am a new Asana user, so I have not mastered the platform by any means. However, the more I use it the more things I think about that could be put in Asana to help us track our goals and map them to our strategic plan rather than just seeing how we are doing at our annual retreat.The training videos are very helpful, making it easier to use the features. It was easy to more my tasks from Google tasks into Asana. I keep it running all day and it helps keep my on track. I love the ability to put in estimated time for tasks, so I can pick a quick task if I am between meetings.Because of the huge potential for being able to keep track of the big picture and to see who is working on what, I really recommend Asana.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Asana?Training videos (at least so far) are geared to production, not a non-profit like a library. There is a pretty steep learning curve. You can get the basics quickly, but learning to really use all the features to maximum advantage is a bit difficult.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Asana solving and how is that benefiting you?Helps our Marketing team see what project is being worked on and who is working on it. It is a HUGE help to our Facilities team, since there are different requirements depending on the size of the job. Through Asana they were able to build templates with the requirements for each type of job (paperwork, approvals, etc.) so no step will get forgotten on the jobs moving forward. I am working to build a portfolio for our strategic plan so we can see how we are doing for the year and the run of the plan.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.",

      "review": "What do you like best about Asana?Asana offers lots of flexibility in how you set it up and use it. We have multiple departments using Asana, and we all use it slightly different to fit our needs—depending upon what we are tracking or planning. I'm not sure about other departments, but our department uses Asana all day every day to keep track of our shared projects and tasks. I like that I can look at the overall project lists, or just look at my own task list. I like that I can customize the notifications that I receive so that nothing gets missed!Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Asana?We have a paid Starter account ($132/year per user x 20 = $2637) and I would love to take advantage of the \"Rules\" feature, but we only get 250 a month, which isn't very many for 20 users. I wish I could get more, but we'd have to upgrade to the Advanced plan and that would cost me an ADDITIONAL $168/year per user x 20 = $3360. BummerReview collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Asana solving and how is that benefiting you?We can track our shared project from beginning to end in Asana. At a glance, I can look and see the status of any project or task at any time. It's easy for me to see where it's at or who it's with if I need more details. We can add all of our supporting documents to the project so it's easy to find what you're looking for instead of digging through emails. It also allows me to review my employee's task lists on a daily basis to help them prioritize and manage their day.We have an email marketing calendar that is shared, so it makes it easy to see what emails are going out when, making it easy to schedule emails and spread them out. This ensures that we don't have multiple people sending emails on the same day. We don't want to overload our customer base by flooding their email box!Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.",

      "review": "What do you like best about Asana?Sounds simple, but the built-in light/dark mode is a big feature. It's straight-forward to use as an Administrator once your permissions are set up correctly.The UI is very neat and there's lots of options for folders and sub-folders for tasks. For example you can have a main overarching Portfolio (Marketing) then projects in that portfolio (Design work) and then tasks in each Project for neat organisation. You can associate work to teams or to people or entire projects to teams or people. You can also create tasks on behalf of someone and message in-app as well.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Asana?It wasn't obvious that permissions needed to be set up specifically prior to having people use it out-of-the-box. Because if you don't, there's literally zero way to delete or edit a project that was created by someone else, even if you're the admin who PAYS the very high subscription price of Asana. I've had to have multiple meetings with different employees to run them through manually giving me Project Admin of their Projects, JUST so I could delete the project or rename it. I can only imagine how much of a pain in the butt this would have been if I had 10x the amount of employees and hadn't noticed this earlier.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Asana solving and how is that benefiting you?Transparency of work being completed by remote workersReview collected by and hosted on G2.com.",

      "review": "What do you like best about Asana?Lots of features and flexibility on how to set it up for our needs.Multi homing is a great feature because that reflects reality - many a times, a project is part of many portfolios and a task/milestone is part of many projects.Goals section and the Strategy map to connect goals and portfolios/projects is Fantastic.Mostly intuitive.Once we have learnt it, it is very easy to use.I am impressed with overall speed and sync speed too. What my colleague updates, I can see it near instantly - this is Awesome.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Asana?There is a learning curve. I know that Asana provides onboarding help and training help. So, ideally this should mitigate the issue of the learning curve.Reporting specific to certain tasks/milestones/section is missing as a feature. Meaning, reporting tells how many tasks got completed or had a certain value, but if I want to report specifically on the values of certain tasks against other tasks then such a feature isn't there.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Asana solving and how is that benefiting you?We have Jira for our Agile Project Management. But we are using Asana for Executive Leadership level tracking and reporting of all projects and intitiatives.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.",

It keeps everyone aligned and focused without micromanagement.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Asana?Occasionally, the flexibility of task organization can lead to clutter if team members aren't disciplined in their use of tags and sections. It also takes a bit of onboarding time for new users unfamiliar with project management tools. But once the team adapts, these issues fade away.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Asana solving and how is that benefiting you?Asana helps us centralize our work processes and avoid miscommunication between departments.

Our company is growing and now it's not enough to communicate via email or messengers. Now it's important to keep track of projects, see notifications about status changes, and respond quickly to changes.The main mistake people make is that they don't learn the basic functionality and don't understand how to use features like Inbox, My Tasks, and Rules.The program is also fast. The developers have thought for us about what we need to work and we don't need a lot of customizationReview collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Asana?So far, I haven't found anything I don't like.

We also provide training to the local community. We have more than 30 communities, and it all turned into a large amount of data with a bunch of separate folders, tables, and numbers. Asana allowed us to structure it into teams and corresponding projects. Now everyone knows where to look for information.

We often ask ourself if it is needed to keep asana or if we could just build these things ourself.I think for asana it is crucial to either work on features that make it irreplaceable or to work on the connection to other softwares and take over a crucial step which the others can't cover.Also just more features are often not helpful, since many customers probably don't use many of them - just more features won't help them.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Asana solving and how is that benefiting you?It combines different projects on one map and supports us in assigning tasks.The problem that it solves is the easy usage and creation of big timetable's.
